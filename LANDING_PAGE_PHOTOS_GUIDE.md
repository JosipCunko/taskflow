## ðŸ”„ How to Update Photos

### 1. Take New Screenshots

For each feature, take high-quality screenshots:

**Recommended Settings:**

- Resolution: 1280x720 (16:9 aspect ratio)
- Format: PNG for best quality
- Browser: Use a clean browser window (no extensions visible)
- Zoom: 100% browser zoom for crisp text

### 2. Optimize Images

Before adding to the project:

- Compress images to reduce file size (aim for <500KB each)
- Maintain 16:9 aspect ratio for consistency
- Use PNG format for screenshots with text
- Ensure images are sharp and clear

## ðŸš€ Testing Updated Images

2. **Check Image Loading:**

   - Verify all images load correctly
   - Check for proper aspect ratios
   - Ensure no broken image icons

3. **Responsive Testing:**

   - Test on different screen sizes
   - Verify images look good on mobile devices

4. **Performance Check:**
   - Ensure images load quickly
   - Check total page load time

## ðŸ“± Image Specifications

- **Format:** PNG (preferred for screenshots)
- **Dimensions:** 1280x720 pixels (16:9 ratio)
- **File Size:** <500KB per image (optimize as needed)
- **Quality:** High quality, crisp text, clear UI elements

## ðŸ”§ Troubleshooting

**Images look blurry?**

- Ensure original screenshots are high resolution
- Check browser zoom level when taking screenshots
- Verify image compression didn't reduce quality too much

**Layout issues?**

- Verify aspect ratio is 16:9 (1280x720)
- Check if all images have consistent dimensions
- Test responsive behavior on different screen sizes
- Consider using WebP format for even better compression (but PNG is fine for screenshots)
