## üîî Notification System Deep Dive

### Architecture

The notification system provides intelligent, contextual alerts to help users stay productive. It automatically generates notifications based on task behavior, deadlines, and user patterns.

### Database Schemas

#### Task Schema

```typescript
interface Task {
  id: string;
  userId: string;
  title: string;
  description?: string;
  icon: string;
  color: string;
  isPriority: boolean;
  isReminder: boolean;
  delayCount: number;
  tags?: string[];
  createdAt: Date;
  updatedAt: Date;
  experience?: "bad" | "okay" | "good" | "best";
  dueDate: Date;
  startTime?: { hour: number; minute: number };
  completedAt?: Date;
  status: "pending" | "completed" | "delayed";
  isRepeating?: boolean;
  repetitionRule?: RepetitionRule;
  duration?: {
    hours: number;
    minutes: number;
  };
}
```

#### Notification Schema

```typescript
interface Notification {
  id: string;
  userId: string;
  type: NotificationType;
  priority: NotificationPriority;
  title: string;
  message: string;
  actionText?: string;
  actionUrl?: string;
  taskId?: string;
  isRead: boolean;
  isArchived: boolean;
  createdAt: Date;
  readAt?: Date;
  data?: Record<string, unknown>;
  expiresAt?: Date;
}
```

### Notification Types & Rules

| Type                      | Trigger                            | Priority    | Expiration      |
| ------------------------- | ---------------------------------- | ----------- | --------------- |
| **Task at Risk**          | Repeating task with delayCount ‚â• 3 | HIGH        | 7 days          |
| **Task Overdue**          | Past due date                      | HIGH/URGENT | 14 days         |
| **Task Due Soon**         | Due within 24 hours                | HIGH/MEDIUM | 1 day after due |
| **Streak at Risk**        | Consistency about to break         | HIGH        | 3 days          |
| **Streak Milestone**      | New streak achievement             | MEDIUM      | 30 days         |
| **Priority Task Pending** | High-priority task needs attention | HIGH        | 7 days          |
| **Achievement Unlocked**  | New milestones reached             | MEDIUM      | 30 days         |
| **Weekly Summary**        | Performance insights               | LOW         | 7 days          |

### Key Features

- **Automatic Generation**: Created on task operations and daily checks
- **Smart Prioritization**: Priority based on urgency and importance
- **Batch Operations**: Mark all as read, bulk actions
- **Real-time Updates**: Live notification count and status
- **Contextual Actions**: Direct links to relevant tasks/pages
- **Performance Optimized**: Pagination, indexing, and automatic cleanup

### API Integration

```typescript
// Generate notifications for user
import { generateNotificationsForUser } from "@/app/_lib/notifications";
await generateNotificationsForUser(userId, tasks);

// Create custom notification
import { createNotification } from "@/app/_lib/notifications";
await createNotification({
  userId: "user123",
  type: "TASK_OVERDUE",
  priority: "HIGH",
  title: "‚è∞ Task Overdue",
  message: 'Your task "Complete project" is 2 days overdue',
  actionText: "Complete Now",
  actionUrl: "/webapp/tasks/task123",
  taskId: "task123",
  expiresAt: addDays(new Date(), 7),
});
```

### Performance Considerations

- **Firestore Indexes**: Optimized queries on userId, createdAt, isRead
- **Pagination**: Limited notifications per request
- **Expiration**: Automatic cleanup of expired notifications
- **Caching**: Client-side notification stats caching

### Firebase Authentication & Firestore Security Rules

#### Understanding the Authentication Issue

The main reason my firebase rules are failing is almost certainly that `request.auth` is null when your client-side code tries to access Firestore.

When you use NextAuth.js, it manages user authentication and creates its own session. However, this session is separate from Firebase Authentication. For `request.auth` to be populated in your Firestore security rules, the user must be explicitly signed into Firebase on the client using the Firebase SDK.

The fact that changing the tasks rule to `allow read, update, delete: if true;` works is a strong indicator that the client is not authenticated with Firebase.

#### The Solution: Custom Firebase Tokens

To fix this, I linked the NextAuth session to a Firebase session. When a user is authenticated with NextAuth, Next.js backend generates a Firebase custom token.

Client-side code fetches this custom token. The client then uses `signInWithCustomToken()` from the Firebase SDK to sign the user into Firebase.

Once the user is signed in with the custom token, `request.auth` will be correctly populated in your security rules, and they will start working as you expect.

A component like `AuthProvider.tsx` is the perfect place to orchestrate this client-side logic.

#### Server vs Client Authentication

On the server, you are authenticated with NextAuth, but you are not authenticated with Firebase.
These are two completely separate authentication systems.

Think of it like this:

- **NextAuth.js** is the Front Door Security Guard for your entire application building. They check your ID (from Google, GitHub, etc.) and give you a session cookie, which is like an ID badge that proves you're allowed inside the building.
- **Firebase** is a Secure Vault inside the building. This vault has its own separate, high-tech lock. Your building ID badge won't open the vault. You need a specific key card (a Firebase Auth token) that is only valid for the vault.

#### How `getServerSession(authOptions)` Works

The Front Door Security Guard (`getServerSession`) works because you carry your ID badge (the NextAuth session cookie) with you everywhere you go inside the building.

- When a user logs in through a NextAuth provider, NextAuth creates a secure, encrypted, httpOnly cookie in the user's browser.
- Every single request the browser makes to your Next.js server‚Äîwhether it's to render a Server Component, call a Route Handler, or execute a Server Action‚Äîautomatically includes this cookie.
- `getServerSession(authOptions)` is a server-side function that knows how to find this cookie in the incoming request, decrypt it using your `NEXTAUTH_SECRET`, and validate it.

So, on the server, you can always ask "Is this person allowed in the building?" and `getServerSession` will give you a reliable "yes" or "no" and tell you who they are, because the proof is sent with every request.

#### Why Firebase Fails on the Server (Without the Admin SDK)

The Secure Vault (Firestore) is different:

**On the Client:** When we call `signInWithCustomToken` in the `FirebaseAuthProvider`, the Firebase client-side SDK establishes a session in the browser. It stores its own authentication token (that special key card for the vault) in the browser's IndexedDB. When your client-side code makes a request to Firestore, the SDK automatically attaches this token. Your security rules see the token and say, "Okay, this key card is valid, open the vault."

**On the Server:** Your server-side code (in a Server Component or Server Action) is a completely separate environment. It has no browser and no access to the IndexedDB where the client's Firebase token is stored. The `signInWithCustomToken` call that happened in the browser is completely invisible to it.

When your server-side code tries to use the standard Firebase SDK (the one initialized in `firebase.ts`), it's like walking up to the vault with no key card at all. Firestore sees an unauthenticated request and correctly denies it, giving you the "Missing or insufficient permissions" error.

#### The Solution We Implemented (Bridging the Gap)

This is why our refactoring was so critical. We gave the server a different way to access the vault:

**The Master Key (admin-sdk):** The Firebase Admin SDK is initialized with your service account credentials. This is the equivalent of a master key that can open any vault, bypassing the normal security rules. It's designed specifically for trusted server environments. This is why we created all the `-admin.ts` files‚Äîto ensure that any time our server needs to access the vault, it uses its master key.
