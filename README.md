# TaskFlow - Smart Task Management System

TaskFlow is a modern, feature-rich task management application designed to help users achieve their goals through disciplined task organization and tracking. Built with cutting-edge technologies, it offers a seamless experience for managing daily, weekly, and monthly tasks, as well as a dedicated space for personal notes.

## üåü Key Features

### 1. Smart Task Management

- **Task Organization**: Create and manage tasks with detailed descriptions, due dates, and priorities.
- **Repeating Tasks**: Define tasks that repeat at intervals, on specific days of the week, or a certain number of times per week, with customizable start dates.
- **Precondition System**: Set task dependencies with "Do X only after Y is done" logic (if applicable).
- **Auto-rescheduling**: Automatically reschedules missed non-repeating tasks to the next day.
- **Manual Rescheduling**: Flexible task rescheduling options for better time management (primarily for non-repeating tasks).
- **Task Status Tracking**: Monitor tasks as pending, completed, or delayed. Repeating tasks have specific action limitations (e.g., primarily deletion in main views).
- **Experience Points**: Gamified task completion with a point system for non-repeating tasks.
  - Success formula: (-2)\*n + 10 points (where n is delay count, 0 ‚â§ n ‚â§ 5)
  - Failure penalty: (-2)\*n - 8 points (where n is delay count, 0 ‚â§ n ‚â§ 5)

### 2. Advanced Tagging & Customization

- **Custom Tags**: Create personalized tags for tasks (e.g., morning routine, gym, personal, health, work).
- **Color Coding**: Custom color palette for visual task organization.

## üîî Notification System Deep Dive

### Architecture

The notification system provides intelligent, contextual alerts to help users stay productive. It automatically generates notifications based on task behavior, deadlines, and user patterns.

### Database Schemas

#### Task Schema

```typescript
interface Task {
  id: string;
  userId: string;
  title: string;
  description?: string;
  icon: string;
  color: string;
  isPriority: boolean;
  isReminder: boolean;
  delayCount: number;
  tags?: string[];
  createdAt: Date;
  updatedAt: Date;
  experience?: "bad" | "okay" | "good" | "best";
  dueDate: Date;
  startTime?: { hour: number; minute: number };
  completedAt?: Date;
  status: "pending" | "completed" | "delayed";
  isRepeating?: boolean;
  repetitionRule?: RepetitionRule;
  duration?: {
    hours: number;
    minutes: number;
  };
}
```

#### Notification Schema

```typescript
interface Notification {
  id: string;
  userId: string;
  type: NotificationType;
  priority: NotificationPriority;
  title: string;
  message: string;
  actionText?: string;
  actionUrl?: string;
  taskId?: string;
  isRead: boolean;
  isArchived: boolean;
  createdAt: Date;
  readAt?: Date;
  data?: Record<string, unknown>;
  expiresAt?: Date;
}
```

### Notification Types & Rules

| Type                      | Trigger                            | Priority    | Expiration      |
| ------------------------- | ---------------------------------- | ----------- | --------------- |
| **Task at Risk**          | Repeating task with delayCount ‚â• 3 | HIGH        | 7 days          |
| **Task Overdue**          | Past due date                      | HIGH/URGENT | 14 days         |
| **Task Due Soon**         | Due within 24 hours                | HIGH/MEDIUM | 1 day after due |
| **Streak at Risk**        | Consistency about to break         | HIGH        | 3 days          |
| **Streak Milestone**      | New streak achievement             | MEDIUM      | 30 days         |
| **Priority Task Pending** | High-priority task needs attention | HIGH        | 7 days          |
| **Achievement Unlocked**  | New milestones reached             | MEDIUM      | 30 days         |
| **Weekly Summary**        | Performance insights               | LOW         | 7 days          |

### Key Features

- **Automatic Generation**: Created on task operations and daily checks
- **Smart Prioritization**: Priority based on urgency and importance
- **Batch Operations**: Mark all as read, bulk actions
- **Real-time Updates**: Live notification count and status
- **Contextual Actions**: Direct links to relevant tasks/pages
- **Performance Optimized**: Pagination, indexing, and automatic cleanup

### API Integration

```typescript
// Generate notifications for user
import { generateNotificationsForUser } from "@/app/_lib/notifications";
await generateNotificationsForUser(userId, tasks);

// Create custom notification
import { createNotification } from "@/app/_lib/notifications";
await createNotification({
  userId: "user123",
  type: "TASK_OVERDUE",
  priority: "HIGH",
  title: "‚è∞ Task Overdue",
  message: 'Your task "Complete project" is 2 days overdue',
  actionText: "Complete Now",
  actionUrl: "/webapp/tasks/task123",
  taskId: "task123",
  expiresAt: addDays(new Date(), 7),
});
```

### Performance Considerations

- **Firestore Indexes**: Optimized queries on userId, createdAt, isRead
- **Pagination**: Limited notifications per request
- **Expiration**: Automatic cleanup of expired notifications
- **Caching**: Client-side notification stats caching

### Recommended Firestore Indexes

```
Collection: notifications
- userId (Ascending), createdAt (Descending)
- userId (Ascending), isRead (Ascending), createdAt (Descending)
- userId (Ascending), isArchived (Ascending), createdAt (Descending)
- expiresAt (Ascending)
```
