caching - buggy unstable_cache to getTasksByUserId

sometimes i get task.dueDate.getHours is not a function

trend in analyticsdashboard

// Maybe combine AnalyticsData and SessionData, currently using existing stats fetched from getUserById

- `mostProductiveHour`: Most active hours
- `averageSessionDuration`: User engagement level
- `featuresUsed`: Count of different features accessed
- `achievementCount`: Total achievements unlocked
