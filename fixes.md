# Fixes and bugs

caching - buggy unstable_cache to getTasksByUserId

sometimes i get task.dueDate.getHours is not a function

pageViews are not correctly updated. Page views can be a total of 7 (dashboard, calendar, tasks, today, inbox, profile and notes), but it updates on every session update

userBeahvior collection is maybe unnecassary
