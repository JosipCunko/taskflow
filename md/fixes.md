# Indexes and branches

Read the docs about indexes in firebase console and protecting the master branch in github, I'll need a step-by-step guide how to protect the branch and optimize indexes
My main branch isnt protected, also in Firebase console I got an warning about optimizing indexes.

# actions.js

- Is it a problem if every admin function needs a server action to be called from the client, also some of them are called from an api?

# Review

- offline support
- sw.js
- how do I test the push notifs?
- anonymous data deletion
- autoDelayIncompleteTasks

#Fonts - I noticed that C1Component uses a different font then mine

Inter is the default font used by C1 components. You can add it to your project by importing it in your global CSS file. The font and other styles can be customized later.
@import url('https://fonts.googleapis.com/css2?family=Inter:wght@100..900&display=swap');

# clientCache

- we only use it in AddLoggedMeal => is there really necessary and could we find more usecases of this

# UploadFile not used

# Add thesys api key to vercel deployment

# offline

- 0 css styles were added when I was offline (actually stopped dev server then the white page with base font was shown saying that I am offline and some feature wont work something like that)
- that was while in dev server, didnt test in production on my vercel url

# update skeleton loaders
