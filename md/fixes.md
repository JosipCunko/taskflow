# Indexes and branches

Read the docs about indexes in firebase console and protecting the master branch in github, I'll need a step-by-step guide how to protect the branch and optimize indexes
My main branch isnt protected, also in Firebase console I got an warning about optimizing indexes.

# actions.js

- Is it a problem if every admin function needs a server action to be called from the client, also some of them are called from an api?

# Review

- offline support
- sw.js
- how do I test the push notifs?
- anonymous data deletion
- autoDelayIncompleteTasks

# clientCache

- we only use it in AddLoggedMeal => is there really necessary and could we find more usecases of this

# UploadFile not used

# Add thesys api key to vercel deployment

# offline

- 0 css styles were added when I was offline (actually stopped dev server then the white page with base font was shown saying that I am offline and some feature wont work something like that)
- that was while in dev server, didnt test in production on my vercel url

# update skeleton loaders

# chat sidebar

- when editing a title, chat sidebar expands a few pixels to fit in the input. I would like it to stay in place
