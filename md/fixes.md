# Bugs and ideas to fix now

Add tooltips everywhere where we put title to something. Last time where we did that is in /webapp/notes
nextauth url in env file is still localhost: // env.local NEXTAUTH_URL=http://localhost:3000 # For development - is that a problem?
Anonymous data is not being deleted after a specified time in /login page
/webapp/health layout needs UI changes in mobile view
Adding framer animation to KeyboardShortuctsGuide and useOutsideClick hook
When I delete autoDelayIncompleteTodayTasks from actions.ts, and remove its usage in /today page, I get an unusual error.
Review auto delaying task feature

# Later

Nextjs middleware could be useful - you can just create a file
Tooltip of how productivity and consistency score are calculated needs to be shown in the dashboard page for better UX
