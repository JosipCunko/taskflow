**1. Enhanced Collaboration: Shared Projects and Task Assignment**

Allow users to invite others to their projects, assign tasks to specific people, and leave comments. This would transform Taskflow from a personal tool into a collaborative platform for families, students, or small teams.

- **Why?** Collaboration is a key feature for growth, allowing teams to use Taskflow for their work. Todoist's business plan is built around this.
- **Implementation Idea:**
  - You'd need to extend your data model to include project members and an `assignedTo` field on tasks.
  - Implement an invitation system (e.g., by email).
  - The UI would need to show who is assigned to each task and include a comments section within the `TaskCard` or a task detail view.

**2. Recipe Discovery and Suggestions**

Integrate a recipe discovery feature that allows users to search for recipes by name or ingredients. Include filtering options for cuisine, diet, meal type, and preparation time. Also, provide a section for daily recipe suggestions to inspire users.

- **Why?** This would greatly enhance the health module by helping users with meal planning, finding new healthy meal ideas, and making the app more engaging for users focused on their nutrition.
- **Implementation Idea:**
  - Build a search interface with various filters.
  - Display recipe cards with key information (image, title, cooking time).
  - A recipe detail view could show ingredients and instructions.
  - A "suggestions" component could show a few random recipes on the health dashboard.

**3. Firebase Storage for User-Generated Content**

- **Idea:** Use Firebase Storage to manage user-uploaded images. This includes photos of meals for the health tracker and profile pictures for users who sign up with an email address instead of an OAuth provider.
- **Why?** Storing binary data like images requires a dedicated solution. Firebase Storage is secure, scalable, and integrates seamlessly with the rest of the Firebase ecosystem (like Firestore and Authentication).
- **Implementation Idea:**
  - Set up a Firebase Storage bucket.
  - Create security rules to control access (e.g., users can only write to their own folder and read public profile pictures).
  - Build UI components for uploading and displaying images in the user's profile settings and the meal logging flow.

**4. Upgrading to Firebase "Blaze" Plan for Advanced Features**

- **Idea:** Move from the free "Spark" plan to the pay-as-you-go "Blaze" plan to unlock Firebase's more powerful features.
- **Why?** The Spark plan has strict limitations that prevent the implementation of more advanced, scalable features. The Blaze plan offers generous free tiers for most services, so costs remain low for small projects while providing the flexibility to scale.
- **Explanation of Blaze Plan Benefits:**
  The Blaze plan unlocks a suite of powerful tools essential for building a feature-rich application. This includes **Cloud Functions**, which allow for running server-side code in response to events (e.g., sending a welcome email on user signup or processing an image after upload). It also provides **Cloud Messaging (FCM)** for sending push notifications to keep users engaged. For more advanced capabilities, it opens up Firebase's **AI/ML services** for tasks like text recognition or creating smart replies, expanded **Cloud Storage** quotas, and **Crashlytics** for real-time crash reporting to quickly identify and fix bugs.

**5. In-App AI Assistant**

- **Idea:** Integrate an AI-powered assistant to help users navigate Taskflow and answer their questions.
- **Why?** An AI assistant can improve user onboarding, answer FAQs, and provide a more interactive and helpful user experience, reducing user friction.
  - The AI could be "primed" with information about Taskflow's features to provide accurate answers.
  - saved chats
  - streaming data
